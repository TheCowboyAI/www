# Requirements for Stripe

When you provide a business website, social media profile, or mobile application, it must include (at a minimum):

Your business name that is aligned with the information you have provided to Stripe.
Descriptions of the goods or services offered that are aligned with the information you have provided to Stripe.
Stripe and our financial partners also require that you include the following additional pieces of information on your website, social media profile, or mobile application:

1.  Customer service contact details (this can be phone, email, address, contact form, or an online messaging service contact)
2.  Return policy and process (if physical goods are sold) 
3.  Refund and dispute policy
4.  Cancelation policy (if applicable)
5.  Legal or export restrictions (if applicable)
6.  Terms and conditions of any promotions
7.  Transaction currency
8.  Security capabilities and policy for transmission of payment card details
9.  Consumer data privacy policy

While this information is not required when you create your account, we recommend that you add them to your website, social media profile, or mobile application as soon as possible (no later than when you start selling your goods or services) to avoid possible business disruptions later on. Please also note that these additional requirements can come into effect quickly after sign-up if you operate in an industry with elevated financial risk.
